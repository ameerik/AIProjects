- we will make an AI that determines whether a tumor is malignant or benign

- I used Pandas which is a Python library used for working with data sets.  (x and y)
  It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. 
  The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis"
  and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

- Shift + Enter to run a cell

- drop means that we are removing a column

- Determine x and y

- Split data into training set and data set

- Scikit-learn or sklearn? Scikit-learn is probably the most useful library for machine learning in Python.  (Training set + Data Set)
  The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, 
  regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

- Keras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. 
  It provides an approachable, highly-productive interface for solving machine learning (ML) problems, with a focus on modern deep learning. 
  Keras covers every step of the machine learning workflow, from data processing to hyperparameter tuning to deployment.

- We are building a neural network

- Build and train the model

- Dense is the standard vanilla default neurons you get in Keras

- Activation function Sigmoid is a function f(x)=1/1+e^-Î²x we take all the values from the neural network and plot them between 0 and 1 to reduce model complexity and makes it more accurate. We have 2 layers in this case then the output layer. The diagnosis will be between 0 and 1 hence 1 dense.
